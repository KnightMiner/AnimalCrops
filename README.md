# [Animal Crops](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/animal-crops)
This is a pretty simple mod which adds a single new item: animal seeds. A seed is added for each animal type, and they can be planted on grass blocks to over time grow the animal.

This mod is designed to be used in mod packs with custom recipes for each animal seed, though by default animal bushes will rarely generate which drop a random animal seed when broken. Additionally, using the config file seeds can be added for any mob which has a spawn egg, allowing seeds to be added for mods such as Twilight Forest, Waddles, or even vanilla monsters such as creepers.
